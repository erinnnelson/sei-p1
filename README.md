#Unitled Card Matching Game

##Using the Cards API

**Purpose:**
A card game that challenges the players to select cards and find the ones that match. It's a matching game. After a certain number of strikes, the player loses. If all cards are matched correctly, the player wins.

**Stretch Goals:**
Hard Mode will be a neverending matching game. As matches are guessed correctly, the cards are removed and new cards added in as the remaining cards slide down. Can you beat your high score?
