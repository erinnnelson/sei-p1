# Unitled Card Matching Game

## -an incredible use of the Deck of Cards API, by Erinn Nelson

**Purpose:**

A card game that challenges the players to select cards and find the ones that match. It's a matching game. After a certain number of strikes, the player loses. If all cards are matched correctly, the player wins and goes to Disney World.

**Stretch Goals:**

_CSS Animations_: Gaze in wonderment as the deck comes to life on your screen! Behold the majesty of cards being dealt and also flipped over!

_JavaScript Local Storage_: Want to keep track of how many games you've won? Who wouldn't!? Maybe one day we can all live in that beautiful reality.
